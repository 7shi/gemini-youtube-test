Yeah, but even those acts are tinged with this weird sense of superiority. Totally. He's like, \"Look at me being such a good person!\" Exactly.

And he's telling us all of this in this really deliberate way. Right, because it's not just what he's confessing, it's how he's confessing it. Like he even admits at one point, \"I cultivate my originality so as not to be devoured by the banality of our confessions.\" Which is such a Camus line.",

It seems kind of random at first, but I feel like Camus wouldn't just throw something like that in there. No way, not Camus. Every detail is so deliberate. So what's the deal with this stolen panel? Why is it significant? Well, for me, it gets at this whole idea of justice, which is so central to Clemence's whole thing, you know, with the judge-penitent this.",

It's claustrophobic, secretive, like we're in on this confession, but it's also kind of suffocating. Totally. And that's Camus's genius.

      "audio": "So this Clemence guy, he calls himself a judge-penitent, right? Right. But is he really looking for redemption? That's the question, isn't it? Because the more he talks about his guilt, the more I wonder if it's just a way to make himself feel superior. Yeah. It's like he's saying, \"Look at how terrible I am, but at least I'm honest about it unlike all of you.\" Exactly. Like he's found a loophole where self-condemnation equals absolution.",
