Okay, here is an article based on the content of the video, aiming to capture the speaker's points and perspective:

**Interlingua: European Auxiliary, Not Just Pan-Romance**

You might have heard of Interlingua, an international auxiliary language often discussed online in articles and comment sections. Frequently, it's portrayed as an incredible tool that effortlessly bridges the gap between Romance languages like Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian, French, Italian, and Catalan. Seeing its apparent similarity to these languages, one might ask, "What more could you want?"

However, this popular perception isn't the full story. While Interlingua draws heavily from Romance sources, labeling it simply as a "Pan-Romance" language is a significant misunderstanding.

**What Truly is Interlingua?**

Interlingua is an international auxiliary language (IAL) developed in the mid-20th century by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA). Its primary goal was to create a language for *general international communication*, based on the shared vocabulary found across major *European* languages.

This shared vocabulary stems primarily from their common Greco-Latin heritage. The *Interlingua-English Dictionary*, published by IALA, explicitly states that while the language's "center of gravity lies in the sphere of the Greco-Latin tradition," its basis is the "Anglo-Romance group of languages with German and Russian as potential contributors." It also acknowledges the inclusion of Germanic words related through deeper Indo-European connections.

Interlingua was meticulously designed using a *scientific methodology* to resemble natural European languages, making it relatively easy to understand at first sight, even without prior study. This contrasts with languages like Esperanto, which prioritized ease of *learning* often at the expense of immediate, passive comprehension.

**The Methodology: More Than Just Romance**

IALA's methodology is key to understanding Interlingua's nature. It relied on a set of primary "control languages" to determine its vocabulary and grammar:

1.  French
2.  Italian
3.  Spanish / Portuguese (treated as a single unit due to their closeness)
4.  English

Crucially, English, a Germanic language with heavy Romance influence, was a primary control language. Furthermore, IALA consulted secondary control languages: German and Russian.

According to the "principle of internationality," if a word or grammatical feature was present in a sufficient number of these diverse European languages, it was eligible for inclusion. This system inherently incorporated elements beyond the Romance family.

**Vocabulary: Mostly Romance, but Not Exclusively**

While the methodology included non-Romance languages, the resulting vocabulary *is* predominantly of Latin and Romance origin. However, significant differences exist compared to a purely Romance-based language like Neolatin:

1.  **Classical Latin Words:** Interlingua includes Classical Latin words (like *igitur* - therefore, *sed* - but) that aren't commonly used in modern Romance languages.
2.  **Different Usage:** Some Latin words (like *extra*, *ex*) function as prepositions in Interlingua, whereas their cognates in Romance languages are often adjectives or prefixes.
3.  **Classical Forms:** Interlingua sometimes prefers the direct Classical Latin form over evolved Romance forms (e.g., *ove* (sheep) from Latin *ovis*, instead of forms derived from the diminutive *ovicula* like *ovecla/ovella* in Neolatin; *aure* (ear) from Latin *auris*, instead of forms from *auricula* like *aurecla/aurella* in Neolatin).
    *(Note: Revisions by Stanley Mulaik later added more Romance-style variants to the Interlingua dictionary.)*

**Grammar: Standard Average European, Not Romance**

The most significant divergence lies in grammar. Interlingua's grammar was derived using a "lowest common denominator" approach. If a grammatical feature wasn't present in *all* the primary control languages (including English), it was generally excluded. Alexander Gode, a key figure in Interlingua's development, described the resulting grammar as "Standard Average European."

This leads to fundamental differences from typical Romance grammar:

1.  **Gender:** Interlingua lacks grammatical gender (influenced by English). Articles and adjectives do not change form based on noun gender (e.g., *Le matre e le patre*, *Un libro e un porta*). Neolatin retains gender (*La matre et lo patre*, *Un libro et una pòrta*).
2.  **Agreement:** Interlingua lacks number and gender agreement between nouns, articles, and adjectives (e.g., *Le libros es verde* - The books is green). Neolatin requires agreement (*Los libros son verdes*).
3.  **Verb Conjugation:** Interlingua uses a highly simplified, largely uninflected system (e.g., *io canta, tu canta, ille canta*). Neolatin maintains distinct conjugations (*èo canto, tu cantas, elle canta*).
4.  **Pronouns:** Subject pronouns are mandatory in Interlingua (*Io mangia le pomo* - I eat the apple). In Neolatin, like most Romance languages, they can often be omitted as the verb ending indicates the subject (*Èo mangîo lo pomo* or simply *Mangîo lo pomo*).
5.  **Past Tenses:** Interlingua has one simple past tense covering both completed and ongoing past actions (*Io caminava quando io audiva un sono*). Neolatin distinguishes between the perfective (*audíi*) and imperfective (*stava caminando*).
6.  **Continuous Aspect:** Interlingua lacks a distinct present continuous tense (e.g., *Io canta* means both 'I sing' and 'I am singing'). Neolatin uses *estare* + gerund (*Èo estao cantando*).
7.  **Subjunctive Mood:** Interlingua generally avoids the subjunctive mood. Neolatin retains it for unreality, doubt, desire, etc. (*Èst importante que vènnias* vs. Interlingua *Es importante que tu veni*).
8.  **Impersonal Pronouns:** Interlingua uses *il* (optional, for abstract subjects like weather) and *on* (for 'one'/'they'/'people'), influenced by French and German. Neolatin typically omits the pronoun for weather (*Face frégedo*) and uses the reflexive *se* for the general 'one' (*Se crede lo que se espera*).

**The Confusion and Its Consequences**

Despite these clear differences, the misconception that Interlingua is primarily or solely a Romance tool persists. This stems from:

*   Its superficially Romance appearance.
*   Lack of widespread awareness of dedicated Pan-Romance projects like Neolatin.
*   Promoters sometimes emphasizing the Romance connections while omitting or downplaying the significant non-Romance influences and grammatical simplifications ("half-truths").

This misinformation is problematic. It creates an identity crisis for Interlingua and can mislead learners. People seeking a language specifically to connect with the Romance linguistic family might learn Interlingua under false pretenses and feel their efforts were misplaced upon discovering its European, rather than purely Romance, grammatical core. As one commentator noted, Romance speakers often expect Interlingua to be more like their native tongues and are put off by its "Germanic" tenses or other non-Romance features, leading to frustration.

This confusion can even lead to attempts to "reform" Interlingua to be *more* Romance, diverging from its original scientific basis and broader European goal.

**Choose the Right Tool for the Job**

Interlingua and Neolatin are distinct projects with different objectives.

*   **Interlingua:** Aims for broad European and international communication, sacrificing some Romance grammatical complexity for easier passive comprehension across diverse language backgrounds. Its grammar is "Standard Average European."
*   **Neolatin:** Aims specifically to unite speakers of Romance languages, preserving the characteristic grammar and vocabulary nuances of that family. Its grammar is fundamentally Romance.

Using Interlingua as a Pan-Romance language is like choosing scissors to mow a lawn – it might technically work, but a lawnmower (Neolatin, in this analogy) is designed for the task and far more suitable. Calling Interlingua simply "Romance" is inaccurate and overlooks the unique heritage and complexities of the actual Romance languages.

While Interlingua is a valuable and interesting language for its intended purpose (and one the speaker appreciates), it's crucial to understand what it *is* and what it *isn't*. If your goal is specifically a bridge between Romance languages, Neolatin is the project designed explicitly for that purpose. Be sure to seek accurate information and choose the language that best suits your communication goals.
