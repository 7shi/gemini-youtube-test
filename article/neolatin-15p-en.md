Of course! Here is the information about Interlingua and Neo-Latin from the video presented in written form:

Many people confuse Interlingua (IALA) with Neo-Latin. Interlingua is not a Pan-Romance language. 

Interlingua is an international auxiliary language (IAL) developed by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA), and is based on common words and grammar from major European languages. Interlingua’s most commonly used words and grammar are from the Greco-Latin tradition.

The IALA used four control languages to determine the words and grammar for Interlingua: French, Italian, Spanish/Portuguese (treated as one because of their similarities), and English. German and Russian were also consulted. Interlingua was designed to be easily understood upon first sight, unlike Esperanto, which has a different goal.

The IALA used a scientific method to determine the grammar and words for Interlingua. Specifically, the vocabulary mainly comes from Classical Latin and Romance languages, with influence from Germanic (English) languages. The grammar was determined by using grammatical characteristics common to all the control languages.

Neo-Latin is a Pan-Romance language created specifically to unite Romance languages. A co-creator of Interslavic (for Slavic languages) participated in the 2022 International Congress of Romance Neo-Latin (Urbin, Italy), demonstrating a shared concept.

Interlingua’s goal was more general: to make communication between speakers of all European languages easier. Neo-Latin’s goal is more specific: to make communication between Romance language speakers easier. Neo-Latin retains more Romance characteristics.

Interlingua and Neo-Latin often have similar-sounding words, but the underlying goals for the languages create notable differences:

1. Interlingua includes Classical Latin words that Romance languages do not use, such as “igitur” and “sed,” using them as prepositions instead of adjectives, as would be the case in Romance languages. 


2. Interlingua includes some Classical Latin words used in different ways in Romance languages, such as "inter" instead of "entre". Also, some Interlingua words deviate from Romance forms for various reasons, such as "tempore" rather than "tempo," and "corde" rather than "cuore." Interlingua does include some words with Romance forms (cognates), thanks to a later edit of the language’s dictionary by Dr. Stanley Mulaik.


3. Interlingua lacks grammatical gender because of English influence. 

4. In Interlingua, personal pronouns are obligatory before the conjugated form of the verb because, without the pronoun, the subject of the phrase is unclear. In Neo-Latin, as in most Romance languages, the pronoun can be omitted because the subject can be understood from the conjugated verb.

5. Interlingua only has one simple past tense, unlike Neo-Latin and Romance languages which have two: one for actions with definite ends and one for actions with indefinite ends. 

6. Neo-Latin has the present continuous tense. Interlingua does not have this tense because of French influence.

7. Neo-Latin has the subjunctive mood, but Interlingua does not. 

8. Interlingua has two impersonal pronouns:  “il,” which is optional when the subject is abstract or revealed later in the sentence, and “on,” which is used when the identity of the subject is vague. These pronouns come from French but are similar to pronouns in Germanic languages such as English and German. Similar pronouns do not exist in Romance languages, so they would be translated into the passive voice. 

Comment sections on Interlingua videos often inaccurately describe Interlingua as being purely for speakers of Romance languages. This misinformation is so widespread that it even appears on a Canadian government web page. These comments, videos, and articles often state that Interlingua was created for Romance language speakers, and that it should be completely Romance-based, with words and grammar fully aligned with Romance languages.

The reality is that Interlingua was created to be understood by speakers of all European languages, not just Romance languages. This misinformation can lead some people to be disappointed by the language and feel “betrayed” because they had certain expectations of a Romance-based language.

Some people propose reforms to make the language more “Romance,” but such reforms are not needed as Neo-Latin already fills that role. Rather than reforming a language like Interlingua, it is suggested to use Neo-Latin directly, or a similar language such as Interslavic.
