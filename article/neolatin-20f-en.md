**What Is Interlingua? A Discussion of Differences Between Interlingua and Neolatino**

The video begins with a screen inviting viewers to use subtitles in the language Neolatin. Interlingua is presented as a language easily understood by speakers of Romance languages, which invites the question, is it truly Romance?

This is Interlingua vs. Neolatino.

Interlingua and Neo-Latin are different projects with different objectives. As well, there is a lot of misinformation available about Interlingua.

Interlingua is an International Auxiliary Language. It was developed by the American International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) based on the popular European languages with a shared Greco-Latin origin and, to a smaller degree, with Indo-European origins. Its intended to be planned and artificial, but based on natural languages. The goal is to be easily comprehensible at first sight. This is in contrast with a similar language called Esperanto, which was created for ease of use, but instant intelligibility was sacrificed.

The International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) used 4 major control languages to determine the vocabulary and grammar of Interlingua: French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese (treated as a single unity). To a smaller measure, there were two secondary control languages: German and Russian.

More specifically, the speaker notes that German and Russian were able to be substituted with the main languages due to their internationality. He shows that multiple non-Romance languages have influenced Interlingua, because Interlingua was conceived for international communication in general.

But, he states, "Despite apparent differences, the confusion persists." The reason, he states, is that people don't know about Neo-Latin.

Because Neo-Latin is designed specifically to unite the Romance languages. That is, Neo-Latin facilitates communications only between speakers of the Romance languages, and without the significant influence of non-Romance languages like English. A notable feature of Romance languages is the "doublet". For example, the Spanish word *delgado* is a "paraula hereditada", while *delicado* is a "pr√®stito Latino" with its own meaning.
The distinction is important because Romance languages are derived from Latin.

When it comes to the grammar of Interlingua, the story is much different. A characteristic must be common to all source languages in order for its grammatical aspects to be approved.

The grammar that resulted from the American International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) is a standard average European (SAE) grammar. Because, from its inception, Romance Neolatino was always intended to be used to speak Romance languages. Therefore, a Romance language must be easy and recognizable to those who speak Romance languages.

The video then shows comments suggesting that the interlingua resembles Romance languages. Interlingua contains many words from classic Latin that are no longer used, and a number of words that are used differently than the Romance languages intended.

These points indicate that, while it may be used to communicate a meaning, it does not communicate a shared history.

The objective is to create an international language that would be useful for speakers of all languages, not only for Romance speakers. Also, by being in direct contact with different groups such as neolatino.eu, it makes possible to see in a general way.
