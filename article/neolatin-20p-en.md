**Interlingua: Not Just a Romance Language - Understanding its True Nature and Comparison with Neolatino**

A common misconception often circulates online and among language enthusiasts: that Interlingua is primarily a Pan-Romance language, designed solely to bridge the gap between speakers of languages like Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian. While Interlingua draws heavily from these sources, labeling it simply as "Pan-Romance" is inaccurate and overlooks its broader scope and specific design principles. This article, based on the points raised in the accompanying video, aims to clarify what Interlingua truly is, contrast it with a genuine Pan-Romance project called Romance Neolatino, and explore the confusion surrounding these constructed languages.

**What is Interlingua (IALA)?**

Interlingua, often designated as Interlingua (IALA) to distinguish it from other projects with similar names, is an **international auxiliary language (IAL)**. It was meticulously developed over several decades by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA), culminating in its publication in 1951.

*   **Goal:** Interlingua's primary objective was to serve as a medium for *general international communication*, particularly within the context of European languages. It wasn't designed exclusively for Romance speakers.
*   **Methodology:** Its creation involved a **scientific methodology** based on extracting vocabulary and grammatical patterns common to a set of **control languages**.
*   **Source Languages:** The primary control languages were **English, French, Italian, and Spanish/Portuguese** (treated as a single unit due to their similarity). **German** and **Russian** served as secondary control languages.
*   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary is derived from words common across these European languages, tracing back mainly to shared **Greco-Latin roots**. While heavily influenced by Latin and Romance, it incorporates international words regardless of their origin if they meet the criteria for inclusion. This means it includes influences from Germanic and Slavic sources as well. The *Interlingua-English Dictionary* itself describes its core as the "Greco-Latin tradition" and the "Anglo-Romance group," acknowledging German and Russian as potential contributors.
*   **Key Design Principle:** Interlingua was engineered for **maximum immediate intelligibility**, aiming to be understood easily at first sight by speakers of the source languages, especially those with knowledge of Latin roots or Romance languages. This contrasts with languages like Esperanto, which prioritize ease of learning over instant recognition.

**Interlingua vs. Romance Neolatino**

The confusion often arises because Interlingua *looks* very Romance-like. However, its goal and structure differ significantly from a project like **Romance Neolatino** (often shortened to **Neolatino**).

*   **Neolatino's Goal:** Neolatino *is* a **Pan-Romance language**, specifically created to **unite speakers of Romance languages only**. It aims to be a synthesis and standard representation of the common Romance linguistic heritage.
*   **Neolatino's Structure:** It deliberately adheres closely to the common **vocabulary and grammar of Romance languages**, largely excluding influence from non-Romance languages like English or German. Its design philosophy is comparable to Interslavic for Slavic languages.

**Key Differences: Vocabulary and Grammar**

While both languages share many words due to their common Latin ancestry, notable differences exist:

1.  **Vocabulary Selection:** Interlingua includes many Classical Latin words (e.g., *igitur*, *sed*) and uses some Latin-derived words differently than modern Romance (e.g., *extra*, *ex* as prepositions). It sometimes prefers Latin prototypes over evolved Romance forms (e.g., *ove* for "sheep," *aure* for "ear"). Neolatino strictly selects vocabulary based on common Romance forms (e.g., *ovecla/ovella* for "sheep," *aurecla/aurella* for "ear").
2.  **Grammar:** This is where the most significant divergence lies. Interlingua's grammar was designed using a "lowest common denominator" approach based on its control languages. If a feature (like grammatical gender or complex verb endings) was absent in even one primary control language (often English or French), it was generally excluded from Interlingua. Neolatino, conversely, retains core Romance grammatical features.

    *   **Gender & Agreement:** Interlingua lacks grammatical gender and agreement (e.g., `Le libros es verde` - The books is green). Neolatino maintains gender and agreement (e.g., `Los libros son verdes` - The books are green).
    *   **Verb Conjugation:** Interlingua uses highly simplified, almost invariant verb forms (e.g., `io canta`, `tu canta`, `nos canta`). Neolatino has distinct conjugations similar to Romance languages (e.g., `èo canto`, `tu cantas`, `nós cantamos`).
    *   **Pronoun Dropping:** Interlingua generally requires subject pronouns (e.g., `Io mangia le pomo`). Neolatino allows dropping pronouns when the verb ending clarifies the subject, like most Romance languages (e.g., `Mangîo lo pomo`).
    *   **Past Tenses:** Interlingua uses one simple past tense (preterite) for all past actions. Neolatino distinguishes between actions completed at a specific point (perfective/simple perfect) and ongoing or habitual past actions (imperfective/imperfect).
    *   **Subjunctive Mood:** Interlingua lacks a subjunctive mood. Neolatino retains it for expressing doubt, desire, hypotheticals, etc.
    *   **Impersonal Pronouns:** Interlingua uses `il` for abstract subjects ("it") and `on` for indefinite subjects ("one," "they," "people"). Neolatino typically uses the passive voice (`se`) for the indefinite subject, common in Romance, and doesn't require an equivalent for the abstract `il`.

**The Problem with Misinformation**

The misrepresentation of Interlingua as solely Romance leads to several issues:

*   **Identity Crisis:** It creates confusion about Interlingua's actual purpose and scope.
*   **Misled Learners:** Individuals seeking a Pan-Romance tool might learn Interlingua only to feel disappointed or betrayed upon discovering its simplified grammar and non-Romance influences.
*   **Wasted Effort & Division:** Some users attempt to "reform" Interlingua to be more Romance-like, clashing with the language's original design and potentially fragmenting the community.
*   **Disrespect to Romance Heritage:** Presenting a simplified, Europeanized system as "Romance" can be seen as diminishing the richness and specific evolution of the actual Romance languages.

**Conclusion**

Interlingua (IALA) and Romance Neolatino are distinct linguistic projects with different aims. Interlingua is a broader **European auxiliary language** designed for wide, immediate comprehension, incorporating elements beyond just Romance. Neolatino is a dedicated **Pan-Romance language**, designed to faithfully represent and unite the modern Romance-speaking world.

Understanding these differences is crucial. While Interlingua can be a useful tool for international communication and is relatively easy for Romance speakers to understand initially, it is not a substitute for a language designed specifically to reflect the common grammatical and lexical core of the Romance family. For those seeking a true Pan-Romance linguistic tool, Romance Neolatino offers a solution built fundamentally on and respectful of that shared heritage. Promoting either language accurately allows potential learners to choose the tool that best suits their specific communication goals.
